# Musical Design & Progression Rules

## Baseline Feel
Warm, friendly, never harsh. Think “lofi beats to code to” → “epic Hans Zimmer climax” → gentle resolve.

## Chord Progression (looping, 70–90 bpm)
Cmaj7 → Aminor7 → Fmaj7 → G7 (classic comforting anime/lofi loop)  
Played with soft Rhodes piano + warm pad.

## Progress Mapping (0–100%)
| Progress | Tempo | Arpeggiator | Layers Added             | Feel                |
|----------|-------|-------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| 0–20%    | 70    | Off         | Chords + subtle bass     | Calm intro          |
| 20–40%   | 80    | Slow 8ths   | Gentle harp arpeggio     | Awakening curiosity |
| 40–60%   | 90    | 16ths       | Add strings + light percussion | Building momentum |
| 60–80%   | 100   | Triplets    | Rising filter sweep      | Excitement          |
| 80–99%   | 110   | Fast 32nds  | Full orchestra swell     | Climax approaching  |
| 100%     | –     | Resolve     | Big C-major chord + reverb tail | Triumphant finish |

## Voice Milestones (optional)
- 20% → “Twenty percent…”
- 50% → “We’re halfway there!”
- 80% → “Almost done…”
- 100% success → “All done! Great work!”
- 100% failure → “Hmm… let’s try that again.”

## Failure Resolve
If finish_progress success=false → switch final chord to C minor + descending melancholic melody.

All rules must stay exactly like this unless explicitly changed in a future lode file.
